                    A major winter storm expecting to impact large swaths of Tennessee over the weekend may strain fire and emergency service agencies even further as they already deal with critical shortages of staffing and resources. This may potentially be a recipe for disaster for Tennessee residents, especially the vulnerable and those who reside outside urban areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some facts to consider:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol style="list-style-position: inside; font-size: 1.6rem;">
                        <li>
                            Many Tennessee volunteer fire departments and rescue squads are experiencing critically-low staffing levels. While the volunteer firefighter shortage is a nationwide issue, this especially hurts Tennessee as roughly 70 percent of fire departments in the state are volunteer-run.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Many fire departments do not just handle fires, but they are an integral part of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems. Fire departments and rescue squads participate in first responder programs, where personnel are cross-trained as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and will respond to medical emergencies to provide vital treatment until an ambulance arrives on scene. Those who do not provide EMS first response at least provide lift assistance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Nearly 98 percent of counties in Tennessee contain at least some ambulance deserts, where ambulances are 25 or more minutes away during normal conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            42 Percent of the 692 fire departments in Tennessee are financially classified as either “At-Risk” or “Distressed” based on data from the state’s Fire Marshal’s office.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ambulance response times have been problematic in both urban and rural areas. There have been numerous complaints regarding long response times and even ambulances that don’t show up at all. Some of the recent complaints have been in both Knox County and Anderson County.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tennessee has experienced rapid growth in population over recent years, yet our public safety infrastructure has not kept pace. We are deemed the 15th most populous state in the nation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Forecasts are calling for ice, heavy snow, and life-threatening temperatures in the single digits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Power outages are likely and expected.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With conditions likely to be extremely hazardous, disruptive, and slippery, one would hope having additional hands on a scene of an emergency would be expected and optimal. Sadly, we may see emergency response resources tied up completely. For your health and safety (and for the safety of your loved ones), PLEASE BE PREPARED to the best of your ability. This cannot be stressed enough!

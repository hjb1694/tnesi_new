                <p>
                    DUFF, TN - Upon viewing the outside of a small, rural fire station located in the quaint community of White Oak, Tennessee, nothing
                    appears out of the ordinary. This all-volunteer fire department has served a broad area of Campbell County for many years, responding
                    to calls not only in the unincorporated community of White Oak but also the communities of Morley, Duff, and Habersham. Passing by this
                    station while traveling down a backcountry two-lane road, not much may come to mind, but under the surface lies major problems endangering the
                    lives and safety of residents and the many recreational tourists that frequent this area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community of White Oak is nestled far away in a remote location of Campbell County. There are only two routes available to access this
                    location by car, either traveling down the windy and trecherous TN Route 90 that scales the cliffsides of mountains or taking Duff Road, a rough
                    stretch of road that, at the time of writing, is currently being worked on. Over the years, this region has experienced an influx of ATV traffic,
                    a popular destination by many. In addition, this area has also seen a share of ATV accidents involving trauma, structural and brush fires, destructive storms,
                    and medical emergencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This area is within an "ambulance desert", where ambulance response times of 20-30+ minutes are not uncommon. This area is not only experiencing a lack
                    of medical first responders, but the one fire department that serves this area is lagging in the few types of emergencies they respond to. Numerous complaints
                    have been voiced regarding leadership corruption, nepotism, lack of training, and the misappropriaion of funds. Behind the bay doors sit trucks and equipment
                    that is corroding, outdated, and potentially hazardous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Efforts have been made to improve the voids in emergency services the community faces, only to be disregarded by both county and state officials. As the area's 
                    only volunteer fire department crumbles, initiatives to establish a district to take on the task of EMS first response and rescue have been placed on a backburner.
                    Other initiatives such as improvements to emergency radio communications, a critical issue in the area, have been met with scorn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While some residents of White Oak hope to see changes, it is only a matter of time before disaster and tragedy strikes. Until county and state
                    officials make emergency services a priority, we will continue to see the deterioration of emergency services across many rural areas.

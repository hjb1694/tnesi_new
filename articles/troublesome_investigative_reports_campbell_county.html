                    In 2025 alone, the State of Tennessee Comptroller’s Office released two investigation reports pertaining to two separate emergency service agencies servicing Campbell County. Both
                    the Stoney Fork Volunteer Fire Department and the Jellico Rescue Squad have gained scrutiny for various deficiencies and violations. Common issues include mismanagement of funds and lack of appropriate accountability when managing funds. For one organization, more serious findings include a lack of a board of directors to comply with the law, misappropriation of funds, and a case of nepotism.

                    A third Campbell County emergency response agency with ongoing allegations is the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department. Allegations of nepotism, lack of transparency, lack of proper scene safety, lack of adequate training, leadership corrosion, and potential misappropriation of funds have surfaced. An investigation by the Comptroller’s Office has been requested, and we are awaiting the release of the findings, 
                    if and when this occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have reached out to Representative Dennis Power’s office who represents Campbell County to explain the public safety concerns in Campbell County. The staff member requested that I generate a report to present. Please stay tuned for updates.
